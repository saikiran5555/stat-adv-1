    "The probability density function (PDF) is a fundamental concept in statistics and probability theory. It describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable taking on a specific value. Unlike discrete random variables, which have a probability mass function (PMF) that assigns a probability to each value in its range, continuous random variables require a PDF because the probability of the variable taking on any single, exact value is essentially zero (since there are infinitely many possible values).\n",
